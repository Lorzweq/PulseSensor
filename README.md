# PulseSensor
IoT pulsesensor

In this project, a pulse sensor was built, programmed, and deployed.
The pulse sensor's data is transmitted to an OLED display, Blynk, and a database, from which it is retrieved and displayed on a website.

**Materials** 
Jumper wires _8_
Pulse sensor _1_
Adafruit Huzzah ESP32 _1_
